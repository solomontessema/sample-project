Would you like me to generate a full starter script for LangChain or LangGraph agents, including environment setup, package install, and a sample agent scaffold? I can tailor it to your teaching or business automation flow.



This isolates dependencies (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph, etc.) from your system Python
This allows the environment to function normally without touching global packages
